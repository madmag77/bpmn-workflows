This repository was created with the puropse to play with BPMN as a meta model for workflows formal definitions. 

The idea is that we can use BPMN syntax and meta semantics to build workflow descriptions in XML that will be then read by python script and used to instantiate real workflows in Langgraph and run them when needed.
