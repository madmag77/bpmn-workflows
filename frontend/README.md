# Frontend

This is a simple React project powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). It provides a basic UI to browse and start workflows.

## Available Scripts

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will display a sidebar with workflow history on the left and the selected workflow details on the right. A "Start New Workflow" button is provided for creating a new workflow. API integration will be added later.
